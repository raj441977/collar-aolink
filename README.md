#### AO Link

This an utility script for ZHAO II and other popular Animations Overriders that are commonly used in the Second LifeÂ® virtual world.

The script is based on Medea Destiny's AO Interface Script for OpenCollar. Its purpose is to disable the AO when the user plays a pose through her collar, then if the user attempts any movement, the AO is temporarily enabled to correctly override the walk animation.

To use the script, simply drop it into any AO HUD, and wait for it to link. If the particular AO is not yet supported, it might be possible to expand the script for better compatibility.

PRs are welcome : )
